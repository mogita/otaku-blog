I'm Yun Wang, using the handle of @[mogita](https://twitter.com/mogita) (nearly) everywhere. I've worked as a software engineer since 2015. Before that, I wrote programs as a self-taught amateur. You can see my [resume ](/resume.html)here.

I believe in many things: open source, remote working (one [book](https://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Not-Required/dp/0804137501) that I recommend), RSS, cats dominate the human, Neo was The One, the Harry Potter folks do exist, and all those heavenly beautiful things from Michael Jackson's songs.

You can also find a [list](/uses.html) of devices and softwares that I use most of the time.

This site was created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a [customized](https://github.com/mogita/otaku-blog/blob/master/static/css/ezhil-custom.css) version of [ezhil](https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil), without any trackers*. It contains my non-tech posts from my infant time in which you don't want to be interested. This is my personal website. Opinions are my own.
