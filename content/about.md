I'm Wang Yun, using the handle of @[mogita](https://mog.blue/@mogita) (nearly) everywhere. I've worked as a software engineer since 2015. Before that, I wrote programs as a self-taught amateur. You can see my [resume ](/resume.html)here.

I believe in many things: open source, remote working ([reading](https://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Not-Required/dp/0804137501)), RSS, cats dominate the human, Neo was The One, the Harry Potter folks do exist, and all those heavenly beautiful things from Michael Jackson's songs.

Here's a list of devices and softwares [that I use](/uses.html) on a daily basis.

This site was created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) with some [customizations](https://github.com/mogita/otaku-blog/tree/master/layouts), without any trackers\*.

This is my personal website. Opinions are my own. It contains my infant time posts in which you don't want to be too interested.
