If you leave me tomorrow, there&#8217;s one thing you can&#8217;t change.  
Take a minute to resist, then years of time to watch you leave.

There&#8217;s nothing left to prove it&#8217;s me, but the outside world can never change.  
I gave you my most stupid age, you return me the heaviest memories.

I wish I&#8217;d said all the words I have in mind today.  
You think the same way but none of them ever remains.  
The very fast blink is what I fear the most,  
I would have seen it only once when I&#8217;m dying old.

Where had I been, when the story was happening?  
Where had I been, when the story was happening?
