Please try and stay, I have to whisper, for whom behind the picture.  
I&#8217;m not allowed to say what I think of, but we surely sense the same thing.

The air is sweet, the woods are the covers, the grass is our bed.  
This minute I come out of my shell, the shell that never helps.

Everybody could be paranoid, when they believe they are police.  
They&#8217;re just too good at capturing, anything, anything.

It looks like I&#8217;ve had a long dream, I&#8217;m done if I just laughed out.  
That&#8217;s our films, never developed, we&#8217;re meant to be nobody.

Everybody could be paranoid, when they believe they are living.  
They&#8217;re too good at self-persuasion, by anything, anything.

Everybody could be paranoid, when they believe they&#8217;re inspecting.  
They&#8217;re just too good at capturing, anything, you, and me.
