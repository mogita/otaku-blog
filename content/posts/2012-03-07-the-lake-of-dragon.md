A wild plain, all in dark.  
I&#8217;m chasing your trail.

I&#8217;m thankful for the meet at last,  
and that you&#8217;ve been waiting for me to sing.  
It&#8217;s solid where I call for you.  
So I really really don&#8217;t care.

Hush me the incantation.  
Don&#8217;t let me spell alone.

Fish bone, cowry and the light,  
take my hand, I&#8217;ll tell you why.  
Going off the night is pain.  
You left a single choice to take.

I&#8217;m thankful for the meet at last,  
and that you&#8217;ve been my relief.  
It&#8217;s solid where I call for you,  
in everlasting twinning soul.
