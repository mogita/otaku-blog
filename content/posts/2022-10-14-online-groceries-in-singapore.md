Having lived in Singapore for half a year now, me and my wife have been to a few supermarkets and grocery stores for  daily supply shopping. As things settled, there are also various online grocery stores which provide delivery. It makes our life a lot easier. Today I'm gonna share some of the nice stores and may update this post in the future for newly discovered nice merchants. You're welcome to suggest a merchant or corrections in the comment area at the end of the post.
