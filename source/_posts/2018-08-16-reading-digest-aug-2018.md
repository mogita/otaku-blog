Accessing the database with Go needs the `database/sql` package. Apart from reading the official docs, this web site makes it even clearer on "how to" and "what not to do" matters. Learn idiomatic operations on it as well.

While designing the inforcement for our data security, I came across an article which explained briefly and clearly on SQL injection and how to avoid it in Go.

> [What is SQL injection and how do I avoid it in Go?](https://www.calhoun.io/what-is-sql-injection-and-how-do-i-avoid-it-in-go/)

It's also worth a while reading this article, also on the topic of SQL injection in Go. In fact it belongs to a big collection of articles on Go application building.
